## Project Overview
The overview of this project was to help Louise figure out the best time and funding amount to start a campaign.

### Analysis and Challenges
I performed this analysis by filtering all the data, so that I can see only the information that I needed. Such as the total number of outcomes filtered by year and month, to get the best time of year to launch a campaign. I also filtered out all the different types of campaign outcomes by 12 different goal amounts. Each play was filtered by the number of successes, fails, and cancels it has based on the range of the goal. In addition, I also created the two line graphs below to represent the data visually.

A potential difficulty that may be encountered while working with this data set is by not filtering certain columns properly. Since Louise needed information only on specific plays, a wrong filter setting may drastically change the data and may give Louise some wrong information.

#### Results
One conclusion I made about the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date is that a large majority of theater campaigns were successful during the spring and summer months. Once it starts to get cold outside there are way less successful theater outcomes. Another conclusion I can see from this chart is that the failed outcomes are much less volatile and more consistent with each month. The only real big spike in the failed outcomes is during October, when there were no canceled outcomes. Other than that, the number of failed theater outcomes remains relatively consistent throughout the whole year.
One conclusion I made about the Outcomes based on goals chart is that most of the successful outcomes came from either the first or third quartiles of the range goals. 

One limitation of the dataset is that there is no data in the method of obtaining funds for a particular campaign. If there were a few methods of obtaining funds; such as crowdfund, door to door, or posters. Then this would give Louise a better idea for what she needs to do to successfully get a campaign funded. One of the graphs that I would add would include a line chart of the different methods people used to obtain funds and if they were successful or not. With the data we currently have, I would add a graph that shows the number of backers with successful and failed campaigns. This may give Louise an idea on how many people she may need to gather to meet her funding goal.
